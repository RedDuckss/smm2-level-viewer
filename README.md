- Super Mario Bros. U (Will likely not ever be supproted)
- Super Mario 3D World (Will likely not ever be supproted)

## TODO

- [ ] Add more theme support (underground, underwater, etc)
- [ ] Add more game style support (SMB1, SMW, etc)
- [ ] Maybe try 3D World support? (hard to do cuz not sprites, but entire 3D models)
- [ ] Fix gound tile sprite offsets (currently I have no real clue as to which ground tile IDs go to which sprites in the spritesheet. Currently just taking my best guess)
