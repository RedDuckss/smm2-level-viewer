A very barebones course viewer for Super Mario Maker 2

Sprites from [https://www.spriters-resource.com/](https://www.spriters-resource.com/)

Thanks to Gavin Kistner for his [canvas mouse controls demo](http://phrogz.net/tmp/canvas_zoom_to_cursor.html)

## TODO

- [ ] Add more theme support (underground, underwater, etc)
- [ ] Add more game style support (SMB1, SMW, etc)
- [ ] Maybe try 3D World support? (hard to do cuz not sprites, but entire 3D models)
- [ ] Fix gound tile sprite offsets (currently I have no real clue as to which ground tile IDs go to which sprites in the spritesheet. Currently just taking my best guess)
